# `@ubiquity-os/kernel-telegram`

A Telegram bridge for Ubiquity OS, uniquely combining Cloudflare Workers and GitHub Actions to deliver seamless integration with both Telegram and GitHub. This hybrid plugin is the first of its kind to support both worker and workflow functionality, running across Cloudflare V8 and Node.js environments for enhanced flexibility and performance across multiple runtimes.

## High-Level Overview

This bot operates in two parts:

- **Bot API**: Hosted on Cloudflare Workers, interacts with the Telegram Bot API.
- **Client API**: Runs in a Node.js environment (GitHub Actions) and interacts with the MTProto API via a Telegram User account.

### Architecture Breakdown

#### Telegram Bridge Components

- **Worker Instance**: Runs Bot API methods on Cloudflare Workers. Handles bot commands, events, and chat interactions using a Telegram Bot created via BotFather.
- **Client Instance**: Runs Client API methods on GitHub Actions, responsible for features unavailable to the bot, like creating groups or sending messages as a user.

#### Ubiquity OS Plugin

- **Worker Plugin**: This is a worker plugin with workflow capabilities, allowing it to run on both Cloudflare Workers and GitHub Actions.
- **Actions as a Feature**: With a dual-scoped configuration we target both the Worker and Workflow instances, enabling seamless integration with Ubiquity OS.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines the best of both worlds, leveraging Cloudflare Workers for speed and GitHub Actions for long-running features or those that require a Node.js environment.
- **Bridges the Gap**: Connects our GitHub events to our Telegram bot instantaneously, enabling real-time interactions and seamless integration.

### Worker Instance

1. **Hono App**: Handles webhook payloads from Telegram, manages bot commands and event reactions.
2. **GrammyJS**: Utilizes GrammyJS for interacting with the Telegram Bot API, responsible for sending/editing messages, handling commands, and more. Learn more [here](https://grammy.dev).

### Workflow Instance

1. **NodeJS Server**: Handles tasks beyond the bot’s capabilities, such as managing Telegram groups or sending direct messages.
2. **GramJS**: Built on top of [Telethon](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/), interacts with the MTProto API for more advanced Telegram functionalities. Learn more [here](https://gram.js.org/beta/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Personal Telegram account
- Telegram Bot Token (via BotFather)
- Ubiquity OS Kernel

### Installation

#### Environment Variables

The `TELEGRAM_BOT_ENV` is a single JSON object that encapsulates all necessary environment variables for the bot's operation. It consists of three key sections: `botSettings`, `mtProtoSettings`, and `storageSettings`.

You can set up your environment variables by using the provided utility script:

- Run `yarn setup-env`, which prompts you to enter each value via the CLI. The values will be serialized and stored both locally and in your repository secrets.

- **GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN**: Create a classic personal access token (PAT) with the `repo` scope. Set the expiry to 24 hours. This token will be used to generate repository secrets for the environment variables and will be removed from `.env` after the secrets are saved.
- **Account Permission**: The account in which the PAT is associated with _must_ be an `admin` of the repository to be able to save secrets this way. Visit your repository settings `telegram-bridge` > `Collaborators & teams` to add the account as an admin first if needed.

The environment variables are stored in the following locations:

- `.env` file: Required to run the `yarn sms-auth` command.
- `.dev.vars` file: For the Cloudflare Worker instance.
- **GitHub Secrets**: Used by the GitHub Actions workflow.

##### Environment Variable Sections:

1. **botSettings**: Contains bot-specific settings like `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, etc.
2. **mtProtoSettings**: Contains settings for the MTProto API like `TELEGRAM_APP_ID`, `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`, etc.
3. **storageSettings**: Contains settings for the Supabase database like `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, etc.

```typescript
interface TELEGRAM_BOT_ENV {
  botSettings: {
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: string; // Telegram Bot Token from BotFather
    TELEGRAM_BOT_WEBHOOK: string; // Cloudflare Worker URL
    TELEGRAM_BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET: string; // Cloudflare Worker Secret
    TELEGRAM_BOT_ADMINS: number[]; // Telegram User IDs
  };
  mtProtoSettings: {
    TELEGRAM_APP_ID: number; // Telegram App ID
    TELEGRAM_API_HASH: string; // Telegram API Hash
  };
  storageSettings: {
    SUPABASE_URL: string; // Supabase URL
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY: string; // Supabase Service Key
  };
}
```

#### Telegram Configuration

1. Create a new bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Add your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_APP_ID`, `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`, and `TELEGRAM_BOT_ADMINS` to the environment variables.
3. Use [Smee.io](https://smee.io/new) to create a webhook and add the URL as `TELEGRAM_BOT_WEBHOOK`.
4. Generate a secret for `TELEGRAM_BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to verify webhook requests.

#### GitHub Configuration

1. Ensure your Ubiquity OS Kernel is set up.
2. Configure the plugin in your private organization’s repository:

These URLs **do not** contain url paths, only the domain. This is because as standard, the main entry (`/`) is used for github events and the `/telegram` path is used for Telegram events which is set via the bot's `/setwebhook` command or by worker environment variable.

```yaml
plugins:
  - uses:
      - plugin: https://cloudflare-worker-url.dev
        with:
          botId: 00000000
  - uses:
      - plugin: http://localhost:3000
        with:
          botId: 00000000
```

#### Supabase Configuration

1. Create or use an existing Supabase project.
2. Run the migration or copypaste the SQL migration file from `./supabase/migrations` in the Supabase dashboard.
3. Add your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to your environment variables.

##### Supabase Commands

- To start the Supabase database locally, run the following command:
```bash
yarn supabase start
```

- To reset the Supabase database, run the following command:
```bash
yarn supabase db reset
```

- To stop the Supabase database, run the following command:
```bash
yarn supabase stop
```

For more detailed information, refer to the official [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs).

## Testing Locally

1. Spin up a Supabase instance and run the migration/copypaste the SQL file into the SQL editor.
2. Run `yarn setup-env` to set up your environment variables. `WEBHOOK_URL` should be set to your local Smee URL initially with no path.
3. Run `yarn sms-auth` to authenticate your personal Telegram account with MTProto. This will store your session in Supabase.
4. Run `yarn worker` to start the Cloudflare Worker instance.
5. Run `smee -u https://smee.io/your-webhook-url -P "/telegram"` to receive Telegram webhook payloads locally.
6. Define the plugin twice in your `ubiquibot-config.yml` file, one pointing at the Cloudflare Worker instance or localhost and the other at the GitHub Actions workflow.
7. Interact with the bot in Telegram chats or trigger GitHub webhooks as defined in `manifest.json`.
8. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the Cloudflare Worker instance.
9. Paste or push your CF secrets but this time replace the `WEBHOOK_URL` with the Cloudflare Worker URL.
10. Once deployed, use `/setwebhook` to set the bot's webhook URL to the Cloudflare Worker instance. It may take a minute or two to propagate.
11. If you need to revert back to your Smee URL, then simply ping your local worker and it will reset the webhook URL (example below).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/telegram -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": ""}'
```

### Commands

- **/myid**: Get your Telegram User ID.
- **/botid**: Get the bot's Telegram User ID.
- **/chatid**: Get the chat ID.
- **/setwebhook**: Set the bot's webhook url.
- **/setcommands**: Set the bot's commands.

```

## Considerations

- The `WEBHOOK_URL` is set on each call essentially, so the worker should always have it's own URL set as the webhook environment variable. Your local worker preferably retains the Smee URL env var which allows you to switch between the two easily.
- If you have to ping and reset the webhook URL, you will see an `unauthorized` error in the worker logs. This is expected and you can verify a successful reset by using a command like `/myid`.
