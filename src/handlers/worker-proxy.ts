 *
 * - **Event Handling:** When an event occurs, the Proxy looks up the corresponding
 *   callbacks in the `callbacks` object. If no callbacks are found for the event,
 *   it returns a `skipped` status.
 *
 * - **Error Handling:** If an error occurs while processing a callback, the Proxy
 *   logs the error and returns a `failed` status.
 *
 * The Proxy uses the `get` trap to intercept attempts to access properties on the
 * `callbacks` object. This trap allows us to asynchronously execute the appropriate
 * callbacks based on the event type, ensuring that the correct context is passed to
 * each callback.

 *
 * We can trust that the `ProxyCallbacks` type has already ensured that each callback function
 * matches the expected event and payload types, so this function provides a safe and
 * flexible way to handle callbacks without introducing type or logic errors.
